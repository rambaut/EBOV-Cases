2014-04-21,Liberia,,,,34,11,2,6,6,,"From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities.

The number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to two as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future.

Following data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28 contacts). Fifty-nine contacts (36% of the total) have completed 21 days follow up and have been discharged from medical observation.",http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_04_22_ebola/en/
